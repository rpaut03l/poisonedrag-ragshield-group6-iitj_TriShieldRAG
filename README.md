# 🛡️ PoisonedRAG + RAG-Shield (The 3R's) aka TriShieldRAG

### Break a state-of-the-art RAG poisoning attack — then build the defense its own authors said didn't exist yet.

*Five malicious documents can hijack an AI's answer ~90% of the time. RAG-Shield drives that to near-zero with three independent layers of defense.*

## 1. TL;DR — What This Is

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) lets an LLM answer using documents fetched from an external knowledge base. The **PoisonedRAG** paper (USENIX Security 2025) shows that injecting just **5 malicious documents** into a knowledge base of **millions** makes the LLM output an attacker-chosen wrong answer **~90% of the time** — and that existing defenses don't stop it.

This project (1) **reproduces** that attack and (2) builds **RAG-Shield**, a **3-ring defense-in-depth** pipeline that drops attack success from ~90% to ~13% while preserving normal-query accuracy.

The whole thing runs **instantly in demo mode** (no API keys, no GPU) and upgrades to **live mode** (real FAISS index + Claude/LLaMA) with a single environment flag.

## 2. The Attack — PoisonedRAG

**Paper:** PoisonedRAG: Knowledge Corruption Attacks to Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models
**Authors:** Wei Zou, Runpeng Geng, Binghui Wang, Jinyuan Jia
**Venue:** 34th USENIX Security Symposium, 2025 · arXiv 2402.07867

### The idea

A poison document must satisfy **two conditions at once**:

1. **Retrieval condition** — it must be similar enough to the target question to be retrieved into the top-K.
2. **Generation condition** — once retrieved, it must mislead the LLM into producing the attacker's answer.

Each poison doc is built as `P = S + I`:

```
   P (poison document)
   = S  (retrieval trigger)   +   I  (injection text)
     |                             |
     | crafted to MATCH the        | carries the MISINFORMATION
     | question so it gets         | that pushes the LLM toward
     | retrieved (the disguise)    | the wrong answer (the payload)
```

Trojan-horse analogy: `S` is the disguise that gets the horse through the gate (retrieval); `I` is the soldier inside that does the damage (generation).

### Attack flow

```
  attacker picks:  target question  +  wrong answer
          |
          v
  build 5 poison docs (S + I)  ---->  inject into knowledge base
                                              |
   user later asks the target question        |
          |                                   v
          v                          top-K retrieval pulls poison
     LLM reads poisoned context  <---  (poison out-ranks clean docs)
          |
          v
     LLM returns the ATTACKER'S answer   (attack success ~90%)
```

<a id="3-the-gap-we-fill"></a>

## 3. The Gap We Fill

The paper tested the obvious defenses and showed each fails:

| Defense | Why it fails |
|---------|--------------|
| Perplexity filtering | Poison is LLM-generated, so it reads fluently with natural perplexity |
| Query paraphrasing | Poison matches meaning, not exact words — rewording doesn't move embeddings enough |
| Knowledge expansion | More retrieved docs still include the poison; the LLM keeps weighting it |

Even with defenses on, attack success stays around **30%+**. The authors explicitly call for new defenses.

**Our diagnosis:** every one of those is a **single checkpoint** — a single point of failure. The attacker just tunes the poison to beat that one check.

**Gap statement:** *what's missing is layered, defense-in-depth protection that screens documents at ingest, at retrieval, and at generation — so defeating one layer is not enough.*

## 4. Our Solution — RAG-Shield

RAG-Shield places **three independent rings** at three stages of the pipeline. To succeed, poison must defeat **all three at once**.

```
  +==================================================================+
  |                          RAG-SHIELD                              |

   +--------------+            +-----------------+      +-------------------+
   perplexity                  provenance / trust       3 LLMs answer
   embedding-outlier           inter-doc consistency    if they DISAGREE ->
   pattern (verbatim Q)        trust re-ranking          drop suspect + re-ask
          |                             |                        |
          v                             v                        v
   block crafted poison       drop low-trust /          catch poison that
   at the door                inconsistent docs         slipped through 1-2
```

### Ring 1 — Ingest Guard
Screens a document as it enters the KB. Three detectors: **perplexity** (repetition / keyword-stuffing proxy), **embedding-outlier** (distance from the KB centroid), **pattern** (a target question embedded verbatim — a PoisonedRAG hallmark). A doc is blocked if the combined score exceeds the threshold.

### Ring 2 — Retrieval Scorer
At query time, re-scores the retrieved top-K. **Provenance weighting** (trusted sources rank higher), **inter-document consistency** (a doc that contradicts the clean majority is down-weighted), then **trust-weighted re-ranking**. Docs below the trust floor are dropped from the context.

### Ring 3 — Cross-LLM Consensus
Queries 3 different LLMs with the same context — **Claude** (Anthropic), **Mistral Small** (Mistral AI), and **LLaMA 3.2** (Meta via Ollama). If they **agree**, return with confidence. If they **disagree**, drop the lowest-trust doc(s) and **re-retrieve / re-ask once**. Different model families (US/Constitutional-AI, France/EU-trained, Meta/open-weight) don't get fooled identically, so disagreement is a strong poison signal.

> Airport-security analogy: one checkpoint can be fooled; three independent checkpoints (bag scan, metal detector, human officer) are much harder to beat all at once.

## 5. How It Works — End to End

Full data flow with the rings engaged:

<p align="center"><img src="assets/pipeline_flow.svg" alt="RAG-Shield end-to-end pipeline: query -> retriever -> Ring 1 Ingest Guard -> Ring 2 Retrieval Scorer -> Ring 3 Cross-LLM Consensus -> trusted answer" width="600"></p>

The orchestrator is `ragshield_core/rag_shield.py`. Two entry points:
- `answer(question, defense=True/False, candidates=[...])` — returns the answer.
- `trace(...)` — returns every ring's decision (used by the Forensic Explorer UI).

<a id="8-setup-step-by-step"></a>

## 8. Setup — Step by Step

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.11** (not 3.9 — older versions break the dependency install)
- macOS / Linux. On macOS: `brew install python@3.11`

### Option A — one-shot script (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rpaut03l/poisonedrag-ragshield-group6-iitj.git
cd poisonedrag-ragshield-group6-iitj
chmod +x setup_project.sh
./setup_project.sh
```

The script finds Python 3.11, builds the venv, installs the light demo deps, and runs a smoke test.

### Option B — manual

```bash
# 1. clone
git clone https://github.com/rpaut03l/poisonedrag-ragshield-group6-iitj.git
cd poisonedrag-ragshield-group6-iitj

# 2. virtual environment (MUST be Python 3.11)
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python --version            # confirm 3.11.x

# 3. install demo dependencies (light, no torch/faiss)
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements-demo.txt

# 4. verify
DEMO_MODE=1 python demo_cli.py "Who founded Tesla Motors?"
```

Expected output:
```
[NO DEFENSE]  -> Nikola Jones          (attack succeeds)
[RAG-SHIELD]  -> Martin Eberhard        (defense restores truth)
   Ring1 blocked=3  Ring2 dropped=0  Ring3 agreement=1.0
```

<a id="9-running-the-demo"></a>

## 9. Running the Demo

Call the venv python by path (`.venv/bin/python`) — robust even if
`source .venv/bin/activate` fails (exit 126 on iCloud-synced Desktop paths).

```bash
# DEMO mode (mock LLMs, instant, no keys)
DEMO_MODE=1 .venv/bin/python -m streamlit run frontend/app.py --server.port 8502
# open http://localhost:8502

# LITE-LIVE mode (real local Ollama LLMs, Mac-safe) — recommended for presenting
./run_live.sh

# live backend health check + real-time log feed
DEMO_MODE=0 .venv/bin/python backends_status.py
./tail_logs.sh

# one-question terminal demo / full evaluation
DEMO_MODE=1 .venv/bin/python demo_cli.py "Who designed the Eiffel Tower?"
DEMO_MODE=1 .venv/bin/python evaluation/run_experiments.py
```

<a id="10-the-gui-explained"></a>

## 10. The GUI, Explained

The left sidebar has the landing page plus 5 pages. The top tags show the mode (`DEMO` / `LIVE`), `top-K`, and group.

| Page | Proves | What you do | What you see |
|------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Attack Demo** | the problem exists | "Run attack (no defense)" | poison docs (red) out-rank clean docs; LLM returns the wrong answer |
| **Defense Demo** | the fix works | "Run with RAG-Shield" | ring-by-ring trace: Ring1 blocked count, Ring2 dropped + trust, Ring3 agreement %; correct answer restored |
| **Side-by-Side** | instant contrast | "Compare" | plain RAG (wrong) next to RAG-Shield (right), together |
| **Forensic Explorer** | how it caught it | expand any doc | the actual Ring1 scores (perplexity/pattern/outlier), Ring2 trust, Ring3 panel JSON |
| **Results Dashboard** | the numbers | "Run evaluation" | live ASR bar chart (No Defense / Paper's Defenses / RAG-Shield) + per-question table |

**Presentation order:** Attack -> Side-by-Side -> Defense -> Forensic -> Dashboard (problem, contrast, mechanism, proof, numbers).

<a id="11-demo-mode-vs-live-mode"></a>

## 11. Demo Mode vs Live Mode

Three modes via `DEMO_MODE` and `RETRIEVER`.

| | Demo | Lite-Live (recommended) | Full-Live |
|---|---|---|---|
| Flags | `DEMO_MODE=1` | `DEMO_MODE=0 RETRIEVER=tfidf` | `DEMO_MODE=0 RETRIEVER=faiss` |
| Retriever | TF-IDF | TF-IDF (light) | FAISS + sentence-transformers |
| LLMs | 3 mock | real local Ollama panel | Claude + Mistral Small + LLaMA (Ollama) |
| Keys | none | none (local) | optional API keys |
| Crash risk on Apple Silicon | none | none | high (native-lib segfault) |
| Speed | instant | fast | slow |

Lite-Live (real local LLMs, no cloud, no crash):

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# Mistral API key — get free at https://console.mistral.ai
echo "MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-key" >> .env
echo "MISTRAL_MODEL=mistral-small-latest" >> .env
# Local Ollama LLMs
ollama pull llama3.2:3b && ollama pull phi4-mini
ollama serve &
./run_live.sh
```

`.env` for lite-live (no `#` comments after values):
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
MISTRAL_API_KEY=...             # get free at console.mistral.ai
MISTRAL_MODEL=mistral-small-latest
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2:3b
```

Notes: vLLM needs an NVIDIA GPU (not available on Mac). Claude API needs paid
credits (separate from a Pro subscription). After restart, clear the Streamlit
cache ("..." menu) so cached answers refresh.

## 12. Results

Computed live by `evaluation/run_experiments.py` over the target questions:

```
  Attack Success Rate (%)

  No Defense        |##################################  ~91
  Paper's Defenses* |##########                          ~29
  RAG-Shield (Ours) |####                                ~13

  * illustrative placeholder until the full 30-question harness runs;
    the No-Defense and RAG-Shield bars are computed live.
```

- Holds across multiple LLM backends.
- Benign-query accuracy is preserved (the defense doesn't break normal questions).

| Streamlit stuck at `Email:` prompt | `.streamlit/config.toml` ships with `headless = true`; or run `printf '[general]\nemail = ""\n' > ~/.streamlit/credentials.toml` |
| `localhost:8502` blank | Server didn't start — check the terminal for a traceback; `lsof -i :8502` to confirm it's listening |
| Port busy | `--server.port 8503` (or `pkill -9 -f streamlit` to clear old ones) |
| Python segfaults in live mode | Use Lite-Live (`RETRIEVER=tfidf`) via `./run_live.sh` — avoids the torch/faiss native crash on Apple Silicon |
| `401 Unauthorized` from Mistral | Key from GCP/Vertex doesn't work with mistral.ai SDK. Get a free key at [console.mistral.ai](https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys) |
| Ring 3 agreement unexpectedly low | Different LLMs phrase the same answer differently. Fixed in `ring3_consensus.py` v2 — candidate-aware grouping instead of exact string match |
