## 🧠 What Is This Hub For?

Imagine you're studying for an exam on **RAG-Shield** — the defense system
this repo builds. You have three kinds of things to learn:

1. **The story** — what does each part DO and WHY does it exist? → `THEORY.md`
2. **The math** — what are the exact formulas, worked out with real numbers? → `NUMERICALS.md`
3. **The doing** — how do I run it, test it, and fix it when it breaks? → `PRACTICE.md`

This INDEX file is the front door. Every other file links back here with a
**"⬆ Back to Index"** button at the top and bottom, so you never get lost.

## 📖 The Three Files — One Line Each

| File | What it teaches | Read this if... |
|---|---|---|
| [`THEORY.md`](RAGSHIELD_The_3Rs_THEORY.md) | Concepts, diagrams, why 3 rings, comparison with 6 other papers | You're meeting your professor and need to explain WHY |
| [`NUMERICALS.md`](RAGSHIELD_The_3Rs_NUMERICALS.md) | Every formula in Ring 1/2/3, worked step-by-step with real numbers | You need to derive a score by hand or defend a number in viva |
| [`PRACTICE.md`](RAGSHIELD_The_3Rs_PRACTICE.md) | Commands, setup, troubleshooting, exam-style Q&A | You're about to run the demo or sit the viva |

## 🚸 Reading Order — Kid-Simple Version

Think of it like learning to bake a cake:

```
Step 1 — THEORY.md   = reading the recipe and understanding
                        WHY you add sugar before eggs
                        (the story, the reasons, the pictures)

Step 2 — NUMERICALS.md = measuring exact grams and following
                        the exact formula for how much of
                        each ingredient
                        (the math, the exact numbers)

Step 3 — PRACTICE.md = actually turning on the oven, baking
                        it, and knowing what to do if it burns
                        (running it, fixing it, being tested on it)
```

**If you only have 1 hour before an exam:** read THEORY.md fully,
skim NUMERICALS.md formulas, and read the "Exam Hacks" section at
the bottom of PRACTICE.md.

## 🧩 Mnemonics Master List — All in One Place

```
I-R-C           → Ingest, Retrieval, Consensus (the 3 rings in order)
                  "I-R-C, easy as ABC"

BAPS            → Black-box, All-3-stages, Pipeline, Scalable
                  (RAG-Shield's 4 advantages over every competitor paper)

P = S + I       → PoisonedRAG's attack formula
                  S = retrieval trigger (Search bait)
                  I = Injection payload (the lie)

45-35-20        → Ring 2 trust weights
                  "45 cents Provenance, 35 cents Consistency,
                   20 cents retrieval Score" (add up to $1.00)

0.5 / 0.35 / 0.66 → the three thresholds, smallest to largest
                  Ring 1 blocks at 0.5 ("half is suspicious enough")
                  Ring 2 drops below 0.35 ("more than a third trust needed")
                  Ring 3 needs 0.66 ("two-thirds majority wins")

SAD vs GLAD     → how RAG-Shield differs from the 2 attack papers
                  they make RAG SAD (Structured/Attack-only/Demo-scale)
                  we make it GLAD (Generation-covered/Layered/
                  Actually-runnable/Defense-built)
