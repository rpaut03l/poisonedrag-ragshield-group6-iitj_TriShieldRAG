"""
generate_scale_targets.py — build a target-questions file FROM your
actual Scale Mode dataset, instead of using the small demo's
hardcoded Tesla/Eiffel Tower/Einstein questions.

FIXED (v2): the original version of this script had a fatal logic
bug — it asked "What is described in the document titled 'X'?" and
expected the retriever to find that SAME document again by
searching for its own title. But retrieval works by MEANING
similarity, not by title lookup — asking "what's in document X?"
does not reliably retrieve document X itself, especially when many
documents share near-identical placeholder text (see the meta.json
warning below). This produced a demo where every single answer was
a correct-but-useless refusal ("I cannot find that document"),
giving 0% attack success on BOTH sides — a flat, uninformative demo.

THE FIX: instead of asking about a document's OWN title, this
version extracts an actual FACT from inside the document's text
(the first real sentence) and turns THAT into a question whose
answer is expected to be found via normal semantic retrieval — the
same pattern the small demo's Tesla/Eiffel Tower questions already
use successfully. This only works well if your documents have REAL
extracted text, not placeholder text — see the meta.json warning.
